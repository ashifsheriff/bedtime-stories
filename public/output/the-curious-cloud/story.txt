The Curious Cloud

High above the sleepy town of Meadowbrook, there lived a small, fluffy cloud named Cirrus. Unlike other clouds that drifted lazily across the sky, Cirrus was incredibly curious.

Each morning, Cirrus would peer down at the town, watching children walk to school and people hurry about their days. "I wonder what they're all doing down there," Cirrus thought.

One day, Cirrus decided to float down lower than any cloud had ever gone before. "Be careful!" warned the older clouds. "If you go too low, you might turn to rain!"

But Cirrus was too curious to listen. Down, down, down he floated, until he could see children playing in the park. They looked up and pointed at the little cloud hovering just above the trees.

"Hello!" called a little girl with red pigtails. "Would you like to play with us?" Cirrus was so excited that he bounced up and down, which made little drops of water fall from him.

"It's raining!" the children laughed, holding out their hands to catch the drops. Cirrus realized he was starting to turn into rain, just as the older clouds had warned.

Worried, Cirrus started to float back up, but the little girl called out, "Thank you for the rain! Our flowers were so thirsty!" Cirrus looked down and saw wilting flowers perk up.

"I helped them?" Cirrus thought with wonder. He realized clouds had a very important job. A gentle breeze helped push him back up to the sky.

That evening, as the sun set, Cirrus told the other clouds about his adventure. "Being curious isn't so bad after all," he said. "I learned that we help the world grow!"

From that day on, whenever it was time to rain, Cirrus was the first to volunteer. And as the children below looked up at the gentle shower, they would wave and say, "Thank you, curious cloud!"
