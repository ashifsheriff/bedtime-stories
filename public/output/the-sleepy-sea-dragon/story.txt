"The Sleepy Sea Dragon"

Once upon a time, in the deepest, bluest part of the ocean, there lived a little Sea Dragon named Dizzy. Dizzy was different from other sea dragons. Instead of swimming around all day, he loved to sleep! His favourite thing was to curl up in his cosy sea shell and listen to the gentle whispers of the waves.

One sunny day, Dizzy woke up late as usual. His friends, the bubbly fish, the playful dolphins, and the chirpy seahorses, were all busy playing. "Dizzy, come play with us!" they called out. But Dizzy just yawed, stretching his lovely emerald-green wings, "I think I'll just catch a few more winks," he said.

As days passed, Dizzy's friends started to worry. They missed their dragon friend. "Dizzy, don't you want to explore the ocean with us?" they asked. Dizzy looked at their eager faces and felt a twinge of sadness. "I do," he said, "but I'm just so sleepy all the time."

One day, Dizzy met a wise old turtle. "Why are you so sleepy, young dragon?" the turtle asked. Dizzy shrugged, "I don't know. I just love to sleep!"

The wise turtle smiled, "Everyone has something they love, and that's what makes them special. But remember, life is about balance. You love to sleep, but don't forget to live your life too."

Dizzy thought about the turtle's words. He realized he had been missing out on the wonderful world around him. From that day forward, Dizzy made a promise to himself. He would sleep because he loved it, but he would also take time to swim, play, and explore the beautiful ocean with his friends.

The sleepy sea dragon soon found the perfect balance. He discovered the joy of chasing the playful dolphins, laughing with the chirpy seahorses, and exploring new places with the bubbly fish. But when the day ended, he always returned to his cosy sea shell, ready for a good night's sleep.

And so, Dizzy, the sleepy sea dragon, learned a valuable lesson about balance and living life fully. He found happiness in both his dreams and his adventures. That night, as he gently drifted to sleep, the ocean seemed even more peaceful, and Dizzy's dreams were filled with the wonderful memories of the day. And as always, he looked forward to tomorrow's adventures.
