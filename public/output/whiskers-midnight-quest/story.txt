Whiskers' Midnight Quest

Whiskers the cat lay curled up on the windowsill, watching the stars twinkle in the night sky. His family had gone to bed, but Whiskers wasn't sleepy at all.

Suddenly, a gentle tap-tap-tap came from the window. Whiskers opened his eyes to see his friend Oliver, a neighborhood tabby cat, beckoning him outside.

"Come quickly!" Oliver whispered through the glass. "There's treasure in old Mrs. Wilson's garden!" Whiskers' ears perked up. A midnight adventure sounded exciting!

Whiskers slipped through the cat door with a soft meow and followed Oliver down the quiet street. The moon lit their path like a silver flashlight.

At Mrs. Wilson's garden gate, Oliver pointed with his paw. "There! Under the rosebush! I saw something shiny." The cats crept carefully between the flowers.

As they neared the rosebush, a low growl stopped them in their tracks. There, guarding the spot, was Rufus, the big neighborhood dog known for chasing cats.

"What do we do now?" whispered Oliver, hiding behind Whiskers. Whiskers thought quickly. He picked up a small stick and tossed it over the fence.

Rufus heard the stick land and bounded away to investigate. "Quick!" said Whiskers, and they dashed to the rosebush. Under it lay a beautiful blue collar with a bell.

"It's Mrs. Wilson's missing collar for her new kitten!" Oliver exclaimed. Just then, they heard Rufus returning. Whiskers gently picked up the collar in his mouth.

The next morning, Mrs. Wilson found the lost collar on her doorstep. Meanwhile, Whiskers dozed happily on his windowsill, dreaming of his next midnight adventure.
