The Moon's Surprise

Every night, Luna watched the moon from her bedroom window. "Hello, Moon," she would whisper. "What do you see from up there?" Tonight, the moon seemed to wink at her.

Luna's mother tucked her into bed. "Sweet dreams, my little astronaut," she said, kissing Luna's forehead. Luna's room was filled with stars that glowed in the dark.

As the house grew quiet, Luna heard a gentle tap on her window. Curious, she peeked through the curtains. There, floating outside, was a small, glowing silver ball.

"What are you?" Luna whispered, opening her window. The silver ball hovered closer. "I'm a moonbeam," it replied in a soft, twinkling voice. "The Moon sent me to visit you."

"Why me?" asked Luna, her eyes wide with wonder. "Because you always say hello," the moonbeam explained. "The Moon has a surprise for you. Would you like to see it?"

Luna nodded eagerly. The moonbeam grew brighter, filling her room with silver light. "Close your eyes and count to three," it instructed. Luna did as she was told.

"One... two... three!" When Luna opened her eyes, she gasped. She was standing on the surface of the moon! But she wasn't aloneâ€”there were flowers everywhere.

"Moon flowers," explained the moonbeam. "They bloom only when someone with a kind heart visits." The flowers glowed blue, purple, and silver, lighting up the lunar landscape.

Luna danced among the moon flowers, lighter than air. They played hide-and-seek in moon craters and made wishes on Earth, which looked like a beautiful blue marble from there.

When Luna woke the next morning, she found a single silver petal on her pillow. Her mother didn't believe her moon adventure, but Luna knew the truth, and the moon winked again that night.
